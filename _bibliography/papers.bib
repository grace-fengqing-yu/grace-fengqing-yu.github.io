ABSTRACT = {In the past decade, immense progress has been made in advancing personalized medicine to effectively address patient-specific disease complexities in order to develop individualized treatment strategies. In particular, the emergence of 3D bioprinting for in vitro models of tissue and organ engineering presents novel opportunities to improve personalized medicine. However, the existing bioprinted constructs are not yet able to fulfill the ultimate goal: an anatomically realistic organ with mature biological functions. Current bioprinting approaches have technical challenges in terms of precise cell deposition, effective differentiation, proper vascularization, and innervation. This review introduces the principles and realizations of bioprinting with a strong focus on the predominant techniques, including extrusion printing and digital light processing (DLP). We further discussed the applications of bioprinted constructs, including the engraftment of stem cells as personalized implants for regenerative medicine and in vitro high-throughput drug development models for drug discovery. While no one-size-fits-all approach to bioprinting has emerged, the rapid progress and promising results of preliminary studies have demonstrated that bioprinting could serve as an empowering technology to resolve critical challenges in personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and artificial intelligence methods are increasingly being used in personalized medicine, including precision oncology. Ma et al. (Nature Cancer 2021) have developed a new method called ‘transfer of cell line response prediction’ (TCRP) to train predictors of drug response in cancer cell lines and optimize their performance in higher complex cancer model systems via few-shot learning. TCRP has been presented as a successful modelling approach in multiple case studies. Given the importance of this approach for assisting clinicians in their treatment decision processes, we sought to independently reproduce the authors’ findings and improve the reusability of TCRP in new case studies, including validation in clinical-trial datasets—a high bar for drug-response prediction. Our reproducibility results, while not reaching the same level of superiority as those of the original authors, were able to confirm the superiority of TCRP in the original clinical context. Our reusability results indicate that, in the majority of novel clinical contexts, TCRP remains the superior method for predicting response for both preclinical and clinical settings. Our results thus support the superiority of TCRP over established statistical and machine learning approaches in preclinical and clinical settings. We also developed new resources to increase the reusability of the TCRP model for future improvements and validation studies.},
