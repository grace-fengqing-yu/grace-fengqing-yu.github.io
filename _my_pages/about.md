Hi, welcome to my page! I'm a 4th-year student studying computer science at the University of Toronto.

My research interest broadly lies in developing computational and statistical methods for biomedicine. I also like to explore interdisciplinary challenges as I am intrigued by how the adaptability and wide-ranging utility of these methods span across diverse domains. 

During my undergrad, I've had the privilege of working with [Prof. Benjamin Haibe-Kains](https://www.bhklab.ca/) on drug response prediction and with [Dr. Zongjie Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h90fpFAAAAAJ&hl=en) on 3D bioprinting for precision medicine. Earlier, I also worked on landmarking in ultrasound images with [Prof. Pascal Tyrrell](https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/). 

I was also lucky to work on a cool astrostatistics project with [Prof. Ting Li](https://sazabi4.github.io/) and [Prof. Joshua Speagle](https://joshspeagle.com/). Currently, I'm working on computational neuroscience, supervised by [Prof. Maged Goubran](https://aiconslab.github.io/).
