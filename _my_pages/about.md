Hello! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology.

I want to understand the dynamics and mechanisms underlying biological processes. I approach this through machine learning techniques and physics-inspired mechanistic models. Currently, I am working on trajectory inference using single-cell RNA-seq data.

I love to explore interdisciplinary problems. In the past, I've had the privilege of working on computational neuroscience with [Prof. Maged Goubran](https://aiconslab.github.io/), drug response prediction with [Prof. Benjamin Haibe-Kains](https://www.bhklab.ca/). Earlier, I also explored astrostatistics with [Prof. Ting Li](https://sazabi4.github.io/) & [Prof. Joshua Speagle](https://joshspeagle.com/), as well as bioprinting with [Dr. Zongjie Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h90fpFAAAAAJ&hl=en).
